Marvel Project Pitch

Goals:
Render a set of super heroes to the page, fetched from the Marvel API
Search bar functionality so you can search for a specific superhero
Create a team up with your selected superheroes, store that locally in a JSON file
    -Here is where we can get the GET and POST requests to the JSON server knocked out.
